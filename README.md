# BUSINESS CARD (HTML & CSS)

When designing the business card I wanted to reflect its real **form** and add **innovation**. For this reason, it consists of a front and back side, the transition between them is made possible by an animation of a "rotating" business card.

### Files: 
- index.html contains HTML structure of the web page of front side of business card,

- back.html contains HTML structure of the web page of back side of business card,
![./.github/images/back.png](./.github/images/back.png)
