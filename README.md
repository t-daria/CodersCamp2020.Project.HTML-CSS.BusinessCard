# BUSINESS CARD (HTML & CSS)

When designing the business card I wanted to reflect its real **form** and add **innovation**. For this reason, it consists of a front and back side, the transition between them is made possible by an animation of a "rotating" business card.
The business card is available on GitHub Pages: https://t-daria.github.io/CodersCamp2020.Project.HTML-CSS.BusinessCard/

### Files: 

- **index.html** contains HTML structure of the web page of front side of business card,
